# War Survival Dataset: Factors Affecting Individual Survival during Conflict

## Overview
The War Survival Dataset presents simulated data reflecting various factors influencing individual survival during times of conflict. This dataset was generated using Python's NumPy and Pandas libraries to simulate conditions for 1000 individuals across multiple categories crucial for sustaining life and well-being in war-torn environments.

## Data Description
1. **Individual Information**:
   - **Name**: Randomly generated names for each individual.
   - **Age**: Randomly assigned ages between 18 and 60 years old.

   - **Water per Day (Liters)**: Daily water consumption per person in liters.

3. **Health and Medical Supplies**:
   - **First Aid Kits**: Availability of first aid kits per individual.
   - **Antibiotics**: Quantity of antibiotics accessible to each person.
   - **Painkillers**: Quantity of painkillers accessible to each person.

4. **Security and Defense**:
   - **Weapons Available**: Number of weapons available to each individual.
   - **Defensive Structures**: Presence of defensive structures (e.g., bunkers, barricades) near each person.
   - **Training Level**: Level of combat training on a scale of 0 to 5.

5. **Communication and Information**:
   - **Radios Available**: Number of communication devices (e.g., radios, walkie-talkies) accessible to each individual.
   - **Access to Reliable Information**: Availability of reliable information sources, denoted as "Yes" or "No".
